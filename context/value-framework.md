## Client Assessment Questions

### **Profit Assessment:**
1. "What's your biggest cost center that involves manual work?"
2. "Where do you lose the most deals in your sales process?"
3. "What takes your team the longest to complete each week?"

### **Growth Assessment:**
1. "How many qualified leads do you need vs. get each month?"
2. "What percentage of customers are still active after 12 months?"
3. "How often do existing customers buy additional products/services?"

## ROI Calculation Framework

### **Revenue Impact Calculation:**
- Lead automation: (Additional qualified leads × conversion rate × average deal size) - automation cost
- Retention automation: (Prevented churn × customer LTV) - system cost
- Expansion automation: (Upsell opportunities × success rate × expansion value) - tool cost

### **Cost Savings Calculation:**
- Process automation: (Hours saved × hourly rate × frequency) - implementation cost
- Error reduction: (Error cost × error frequency × reduction percentage) - prevention cost

### **Risk Mitigation Value:**
- Compliance automation: (Potential fine × probability) - system cost
- Quality control: (Error cost × error rate × prevention rate) - monitoring cost

This framework helps clients see their real problems through the lens of fundamental business equations, making it easier to justify AI automation investments with concrete ROI projections.
