# copilot instructions
I have two comprehensive markdown files that I want to transform into engaging web pages for my AI automation consulting website:

1. `industry-blueprints.md` - Industry-specific implementation guides
2. `case-study-library.md` - Success and failure case studies

Please help me create:
- Dynamic React components for each content type
- SEO-optimized page structures
- Interactive elements for user engagement
- Lead generation integration
- Mobile-responsive design

Tech stack: React/Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

Requirements:
- Parse markdown content into structured data
- Create compelling visual layouts
- Add interactive elements (tabs, accordions, filters)
- Include lead capture forms
- Optimize for conversion and engagement


### **Step 3: Specific Page Structure Requests**

#### **For Industry Blueprints Page:**

```typescript
// Prompt for Copilot:
"Create a React component that transforms the industry blueprints markdown into:

1. Hero section with value proposition
2. Industry selector (Healthcare, Manufacturing, Education, Retail)
3. Interactive blueprint viewer with:
   - Tab navigation for each section
   - Progress indicators for implementation phases
   - ROI calculators for each industry
   - Downloadable implementation checklists
4. CTA sections for consultation booking
5. Related case studies integration

Make it visually appealing with icons, progress bars, and engagement metrics."
```

#### **For Case Study Library Page:**

```typescript
// Prompt for Copilot:
"Transform the case study library markdown into an interactive showcase:

1. Filter system (Success/Failure, Industry, Company Size)
2. Card-based layout with preview information
3. Detailed case study modals with:
   - Problem/solution breakdown
   - FAST Framework analysis
   - Results visualization
   - Key lessons learned
4. 'Learn from Failures' section highlighting common pitfalls
5. Success pattern analysis
6. Interactive failure prevention checklist

Include testimonial-style quotes and visual impact metrics."
```

### **Step 4: Component Implementation Examples**

#### **Blueprint Navigator Component:**

```typescript
// Copilot will help you create something like:
interface Blueprint {
  industry: string;
  sections: Section[];
  roi: ROIData;
  timeline: TimelineItem[];
  compliance: ComplianceItem[];
}

const BlueprintNavigator = () => {
  const [selectedIndustry, setSelectedIndustry] = useState('healthcare');
  const [activeSection, setActiveSection] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div className="blueprint-container">
      {/* Industry selector */}
      <IndustryTabs />
      
      {/* Interactive blueprint sections */}
      <BlueprintSections />
      
      {/* ROI calculator */}
      <ROICalculator industry={selectedIndustry} />
      
      {/* Implementation timeline */}
      <TimelineVisualizer />
      
      {/* Lead capture */}
      <ConsultationCTA />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### **Step 5: Content Parsing Strategy**

Ask Copilot to create a markdown parser:

```typescript
// Prompt: "Create a utility to parse my markdown files into structured data"
const parseBlueprints = (markdownContent: string) => {
  // Copilot will help extract:
  // - Industry sections
  // - Implementation timelines
  // - ROI data
  // - Compliance requirements
  // - Risk mitigation strategies
};

const parseCaseStudies = (markdownContent: string) => {
  // Extract:
  // - Success/failure classification
  // - Company details
  // - Problem/solution pairs
  // - Results metrics
  // - Lessons learned
};
```

### **Step 6: Interactive Features to Request**

#### **For Blueprints:**
```markdown
"Add these interactive elements:
1. Implementation progress tracker
2. Cost-benefit calculator for each automation

```

```

2. Schema markup for educational content
3. Internal linking between blueprints and case studies
4. Social sharing optimization
5. Page speed and Core Web Vitals
